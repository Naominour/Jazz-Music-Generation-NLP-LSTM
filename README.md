## Project Architecture
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The `preprocess.py` and `data_utils.py` files handle the preprocessing of musical data, including the conversion of MIDI files into a format suitable for training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The `Improvise_a_Jazz_Solo_with_an_LSTM_Network_v4.ipynb` notebook contains the core LSTM model implementation. It builds upon existing deep learning frameworks to train the model on prepared data.
   - `generateTestCases.py` provides test cases to validate the training process.

3. **Music Generation**:
   - The trained LSTM model is used to generate new jazz solos. The `inference_code.py` file contains the logic for inference and music generation.
   - `midi.py` and `music_utils.py` are utilized to handle MIDI files and other music-related data processing tasks.

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - `qa.py` and `test_utils.py` include scripts to validate the quality and correctness of the generated music.

5. **Output Management**:
   - The `outputs.py` file manages the results and outputs of the music generation process.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning**: Utilise an LSTM network for music generation.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Handle time series data and sequences effectively.
- **Generative Models**: Create new jazz solos based on learned patterns.
- **Music Processing**: Use the Music21 library for musical data manipulation.
